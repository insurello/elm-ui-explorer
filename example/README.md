# elm-ui-explorer example

Here's how we use `elm-ui-explorer` at Insurello.
This is actual production code though we've only included the necessary code to show the UI Explorer pages (which is why a lot of the Elm modules have only one or two functions in them).

To run it locally, make sure you have Node.js with npm installed and then run `npm ci` followed by `npm start`.
